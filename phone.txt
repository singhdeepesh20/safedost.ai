✔️ Save these numbers in your phone.
✔️ Share them with family/friends.
✔️ Available 24x7 in most states.
👉 You can simply create a new file called helpline_numbers.txt inside your ./data folder and paste this content.
That way, when the RAG chatbot is asked “Which number should I call if I face harassment?”, it can retrieve from this file.

Do you also want me to generate content for self_defense_tips.pdf and safe_travel_checklist.txt so your RAG has at least 3 strong documents to start with?
