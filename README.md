The Story

Every day, countless women step out into the world with courage 🌍.
But with courage comes risk — harassment in public spaces, unsafe transport, late-night travel, digital abuse, and more.

What if there was always a friend by your side?
A dost who never sleeps, never ignores, and always guides you toward safety.

That’s why we created SafeDost.AI.
Not just an app, but a digital companion for women’s security.

💡 What is SafeDost.AI?

SafeDost.AI is an AI-powered safety chatbot designed to:

* Provide quick, verified guidance in unsafe situations

* Offer awareness & training tips (self-defense, helpline numbers, digital safety)

* Learn from women’s safety manuals, laws, and verified resources

* Chat with you in a simple, WhatsApp-style interface

* Ensure peace of mind with reliable safety instructions, anytime, anywhere

⚙️ How It Works

Knowledge Base 📚

* SafeDost.AI is powered by documents on women’s security (laws, helplines, awareness PDFs).

* You can add new docs into the ./data folder.

Smart Search (FAISS) 🔍

* The bot stores this knowledge in an AI-friendly format.

* So when you ask, “What should I do if I feel followed?”, it instantly finds the best guidance.

AI Brain (Groq LLM) 🧠

* Uses Groq’s superfast AI to generate clear, safe, and actionable advice.

* Always cites sources so women know it’s trustworthy.

Chat UI 💬

* A familiar chat interface, designed like WhatsApp.

* Women can simply type and get help in seconds.

Why SafeDost.AI Matters

Unlike generic chatbots, SafeDost.AI is built with women in mind:

* Women-focused knowledge base (laws, helplines, awareness guides)

* Real-world safety steps instead of vague advice

* Transparency → shows exactly which guide it used

* Fast & reliable (Groq + HuggingFace AI)

✨ The Vision

We dream of a future where every woman knows:
“Even if I’m walking alone… I’m never truly alone.”

SafeDost.AI is that invisible companion — a dost that cares, protects, and empowers women every step of the way.
